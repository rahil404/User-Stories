Instructions:

1. Make sure to install MongoDB as a server in your computer. Follow instructions from the official website.

2. Install Go following the instructions from the official website. Create new folder named `test-project ` in the `src` folder of your GoPath, move this file in the src folder. Head to this file through command prompt and run following commands:

(i)go get github.com/gorilla/mux

(ii)go get go.mongodb.org/mongo-driver/mongo

This will install the dependencies. Then simply run "go run main.go" to turn the backend api active.

3. Now head back to this directory and run "yarn start" which will start the app in port 3000.
